dont fucking do any GUI work in other threads, otherwise this shit will randomly crash
fuck floats, always use ints when you can
don't use any timers in other threads or the program will cry
QThreads have a small delay, so don't do any work with the QThread variables in other threads
for the love of god use objects instead of x and ys in pyqtSignal it's so much better

Conclusion: I love multithreading <3
